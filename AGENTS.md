## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

TanStack Start / Vite / Bun portal (GitHub repo `trackdubllc/trackdub-api-hub`). Local: `bun install`, then `bun run dev` or `bun run build`.

- Install with Bun (`bun.lock` is canonical; `package-lock.json` may also exist, prefer Bun).
- Auth and API calls need live/staging backend secrets when testing logged-in flows. Prefer Cursor Secrets over committed env files.
- Agent verification default: `bun run build`. Skip deploy unless asked.
